                        Pixel games have a rich history, dating back to the early arcade cabinets and home consoles of the 1970s and 80s. Back then, games were built with simple pixel art due to limited technology, but developers turned those tiny squares into iconic characters and unforgettable worlds. Even today, pixel-style games remain popular for their charm, nostalgia, and creativity.
                        <br><br>
                        PixelPlay Arcade takes inspiration from that legacy. While this site is a school project, our goal is to celebrate the evolution of gaming and highlight how far pixel-based adventures have come—from humble beginnings to the diverse experiences we enjoy today.                    <br><br>
